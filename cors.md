Today I did a lot of things. I implimented what I learned during the weekend about using the cors npm package to enable cors configurataion for my websocket projects.   
The reason why I wanted to do this is so I make sure that I can use the right-click Open With Live Server option and I immediately get connected to the same port that my server listens to instead of port 5500 which is default.   
I alaso disgussed various topics with my boyfriend regarding coding, such as floading point numbers and how to get around them with npm packages such as accounting.js. This package (and problem) is relevant for an accountant assistant like me who would like to do projects later on accounting related projects.   
We also discussed the possibility of splitting some of my projects into to separate front-end and back-end projects as an alternative to having both front- and back-end mixed up in the same project. I decided to ask the same question on reddit for a second opinion.
