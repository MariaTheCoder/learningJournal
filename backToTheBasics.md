After consideration I have decided to restructure my future learning process with the hopes that the changes will increase my progress and help realize my dream of landing a job as a software developer.
For this reason, I decided to drop out of the GraphDBi project that I joined with two far more experienced developers to take back those 8 hours weekly to dive deeper and more intensely into understanding the very basics.
Perhaps I can join the project again at a later point once my skills and knowledge has developed.

These days I've been doing recaps on the very basics of JavaScript by going through the seocond course material on FreeCodeCamp called "Javascript algorithms and data structure"

I have come very far with one of my personal projects which has the goal to imitate a bookkeeping software and some of its functionalities. In essense, it is a CRUD application with additional features such as ability to sort values of data in a grid in decending or ascending order as well as automatic change of credit/debit values depending on which accounts are used when creating an account.
