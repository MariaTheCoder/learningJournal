## February 7th

After consideration I have decided to restructure my future learning process with the hopes that the changes will increase my progress and help realize my dream of landing a job as a software developer.
For this reason, I decided to drop out of the GraphDBi project that I joined with two far more experienced developers to take back those 8 hours weekly to dive deeper and more intensely into understanding the very basics.
Perhaps I can join the project again at a later point once my skills and knowledge has developed.
