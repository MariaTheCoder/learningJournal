# June 2021

## 22

Today I proceeded with my project for June where I experiment with making a websocket application. I fixed quite a few technical bugs and with the assistance, the project is much closer to done than I expected by today.   
The next things I want to implemnt in the project are a few more features like a request assistance feature for clients and lists and logos that indicate status of client. Also, I want to assign a name to each user, manually typed in by clients as they access the application.
