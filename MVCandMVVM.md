Today I learned about two different software achitectural patterns: 

* MVC (model-view-controller)
* MVVM (model-view-viewmodel)

I found this ressource (link: https://www.guru99.com/mvc-vs-mvvm.html) particularly helpful with making me understand the differences between these two patterns and also understand better the advantages and disadvantages of these patterns. 

I am undecided about which pattern to impliment in my JuneProject. So far I seem to prefer the logic of the MVC pattern even if it is an older and more outdated than its counterpart MVVM.
