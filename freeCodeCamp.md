## January 4th

New year, new strategy. I have felt like I lack a tool to track my progress when it comes to programming for a while now. I get distracted easily by various topics, leave a topic for a while and then return later just to have to re-learn most of the material again. I have noticed the same trend with my personal projects too.

So, in order to keep a cronological order of my learning, I will go back to using Free Code Camp.
Today I started and finished the course on basic HTML and also half way through the basic CSS material.

Until I find a better solution to track my progress, I will stick to the Free Code Camp 'classes' while working on personal and group projects.

Today I did more lessons on FreeCodeCamp. I am very close to the final tasks which can qualify me for my first certificate, in responsive web design!
