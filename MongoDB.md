Today and yesterday I spent a few hours learning more about mongoDB. In the lecture vidoes that I watch, an older version of mongoose is being used and a few methods/functions area used that no longer work and so, I look in the documentation to find a viable solution so I can still follow along the course. 

Alternatively, I can install the exact same version as the tutor. However, I prefer adabting my code according to the newest version of an npm package. 

I expect to finish the course on MongoDB tomororw.
