Today I learned how to program HTTP DELETE and HTTP PUT requests. I used POSTMAN to test my code along the way and added code to check, if requested element exists as well as if content to edit is valid.   
After learning this, I challenged myself to make a small CRUD application where I have an array movie genre objects as my data. I then proceeded to make an HTTP GET request.    
At first my code did not work properly which turned out to be due to a reoccuring typo in the endpoint. Once this was fixed, my HTTP GET as well as POST, DELETE and PUT requests worked flawlessly. 

I plan to do more mini projects and bigger projects on this topic but for now, I have finished my study session.
