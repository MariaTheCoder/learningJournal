Since the beginning of the weekend and up until now I have been looking into websockets, the npm package socket.io for NodeJS to be more specific. My reason for looking into this topic is that I agreed to make an CRUD application for my boyfriend's next presentation and there are multiple benefits to doing this project.
* It helps me with getting into a new subject relatively quickly after concluding my most recent studies on RESTful servicse/API's (HTTP). Not only is the topic of websockets more advanced, but it builds on top of this knowledge. 
* Learning by doing - doing a project is definitely an effective method to learn a new subject

So far I made a skeleton for the application and am now working on its functionalities. I established a socket so far and need to fix a few bugs.
