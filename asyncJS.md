Since my last entry I have partially been working on projects and digging more into asyncronous javascript programming. 
Today I finished the last lectures on this exact topic from Mosh's course on NodeJS. 

In the last few lectures I learned how to use callback functions to get the return value or object, which is stored in constant variable. I then learned about callback hell and how to prevent this, either by instead implementing the use of promises-based approach or async and await. 

I completed a few exercises from Mosh where the task was to either rewrite an example of callback hell to first a promis-based approach in one task and then an async and await approach in another task. 

Whether I will continue to the next topic of this course right away or if I will return to working on my owrn projects tomorrow, I am still unsure of.
