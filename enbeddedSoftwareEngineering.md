# 2022

## February 1st

Today I got started with my Uno R3 Project Starter Kit. I did the very first project where a UNO R3 Controller Board is connectected via a USB cable to one's computer to make an LED light blink. The code that makes the LED light blink, I programmed in Arduino, a freely available software that can be downloaded and used for this exact purpose.

I also looked more into SQLite and practiced writing out commands for the first time since Sunday (January 30th 2022) on a database made for a different project. It was very fun and interesting to put into practice what I had just recently learned.
