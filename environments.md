During this weekend I learned about how to navigate in terminal and node between environments. 
I learned that often enough, programmers use console.log to test their code during development. However, in order to avoid having to go back and comment out these commands, it is easier to download the npm package called 'debug' and call it when working in the enviroment of 'development'.   
In the terminal, one can switch between different environments by typing in the following:  
`$ export NODE_ENV=development`  
`$ nodemon index.js`  
I also learned about template engines to return a dynamic HTML to a client and how this can be done by using an npm package called 'pug'. 
I was also introduced to the concepts of database integration and authentication. These will be dived into in more details at a later point.
