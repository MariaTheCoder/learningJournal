Today I looked deeper into data validation on the server side. I learned about this by proceeding with Mosh's course on Node.js explaining how to do data validation using the Mongoose npm package. He talks about what validation you can do with either strings or arrays and give an example of custom validators.

Today I proceeded my studies on MongoDB and data validation. I worked specifically with validation and async validation. I also worked on an exercise where I looked up a previously done task where I had an array of objects defined in a js document as my database and built an restful API using express to create, get, edit and delete data.    
Today's exercise was to convert this mini project into a new project that uses a MongoDB database. 

I began working on the project. However, I did not get to finish it before bedtime.
