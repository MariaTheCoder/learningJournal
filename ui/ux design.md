## UX/UI Design

For the past two days I have been looking more into UX/UI related topics as these two concepts seem referenced often in job posts up right now.
I have been looking into what the difference is between UX/UI, looked into what kind of problems they solve and watched a demonstration on how to execute one's very first mini-projects where one takes both roles, using Figma as the design tool.

Today I practiced making my own rough sketch for a project which is uploaded with this file.
