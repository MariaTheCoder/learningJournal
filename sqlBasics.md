Today I dived deeper into SQLite and manipulated with a sample database to practice executing different commands such as SELECT, ORDER BY, INNER JOIN, AS (renaming a coloumn) and so on.   
I also completed watching the videos on advanced Express topics of MOSH's course on NodeJS. 

During a walk earlier today, I was introduced to a possible next project for me which has a deadline by next month. I accepted the task and look forward to challenging myself to work on it. 
The client will give me more details and what is expected of the project as well as relevent topics to look into during this project very soon.
