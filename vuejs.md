Today I did a small intro project with Vue.js, just to get started on using the font-end framework as I would like to at some point use js front-end framework on my existing projects that are not yet polished.
I did a mini project where I set up a random user profile generator that fetches data from a random user generator (back-end) and used Vue to dictate how to display the returned data. It was a very fun first project done with Vue
The project is already on GitHub

Today we continued our work with the graphQL project. I created a new component in Vue and found the data I wanted to transfer to this new comonent and tested if this information was indeed being passed correctly. I also had a short lesson on database theory which I will learn more about at a later point.
