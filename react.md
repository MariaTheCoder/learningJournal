This week my main focus has been on learning React.js due to a project that I recently joined in on. For this project, I will be doing much front-end related stuff which is why I have been working on learning how to use React.

So far I have been constructing simple reusable components and importet them into the app file from where I modify the content of each imported component. I also watched a few tutorials on React and tried starting out a mini React project myself, as a sandbox

Today I got a bit further with my studies on using react. Today's goal was to walk set up a json file containing mock data (a mock databases) from where my front-end application should read data. The setup is not finished up and running just yet but I hope to complete this task very soon..

## Week 42

Since my last update, I have been working on improving my skills with React. Much of my time has been spent on doing a project that is not posted on Github but in Gitlab, while the rest of my studies have mainly been through YouTube videos and smaller exercises on my local computer, which I did not see fit to upload to GitHub.
I will try to become better at documenting my progress in React here on Github as well..

The passing week has mostly consisted of react programming as well as resarching the react library of Material UI. I have experimented (and still am experimenting) with the Material UI Components Grid, TextField, CheckBox and customizing these for style purposes
