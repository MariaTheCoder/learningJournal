This week my main focus has been on learning React.js due to a project that I recently joined in on. For this project, I will be doing much front-end related stuff which is why I have been working on learning how to use React. 

So far I have been constructing simple reusable components and importet them into the app file from where I modify the content of each imported component. I also watched a few tutorials on React and tried starting out a mini React project myself, as a sandbox

Today I got a bit further with my studies on using react. Today's goal was to walk set up a json file containing mock data (a mock databases) from where my front-end application should read data. The setup is not finished up and running just yet but I hope to complete this task very soon..
