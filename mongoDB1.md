This weekend I had very little time to code and so I mainly watched lecture videos on React.js on Saturday and Sunday I tried to get closer to fix my issue with the mongoimport command in the terminal. I am still not able to import the sample files, that I have been given.     
I hope to solve this issue during this upcoming week.
