Since my last update I have been working on my June-project as the deadline for the project has been getting closer. Today I especially spent many hours improving my websocket application to enable my client (my boyfriend and his colleage) to use the application for its intended purpose. For this, I needed to work on a few features and also observed as ReactJS was used to code the front-end of my application whereas my focus has mainly been on the back-end. 

I had a brief conference meeting with my client to talk about a potential new feature that could be useful in the future. This feature in particular is meant to enable a client connected to the server to retract their request for assistance upon solving an issue. I already added a button to do this which is hidden by default and only gets shown after a client has requested for assistance. Upon clicking the request assistance button, the request assistance button is hidden and will only  reappear once the request for assistance is retracted. 

Tomorrow I plan to take a break away from the project for a brief moment to work on another project that I have been eager to begin working on. It is also on the subject of web sockets and I look forward to implementing what I have learned so far and more.
