Today got a brief introduction to SQL by my boyfriend. The introduction happened after he looked at my first backend project. I asked him what the next step would be to evolve my project to which he suggested to make a database with SQL in software like SQLite.   
Most of my day however was spent on programming my project and applying my recently learned knowledge on web requests.    
Next up, regarding the project, I will look into SQL.
