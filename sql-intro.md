Today got a brief introduction to SQL by my boyfriend. The introduction happened after he looked at my first backend project. I asked him what the next step would be to evolve my project to which he suggested to make a database with SQL in software like SQLite.  
Most of my day however was spent on programming my project and applying my recently learned knowledge on web requests.  
Next up, regarding the project, I will look into SQL.

Today Marc re-introduced me to SQL and gave me a brief lecture on database structures. I seemed to remember more about SQL than I initially thought which was quite rewarding as an experience. I did various of tasks, mostly practiced doing the most common commands and was able to ask questions about the usage of SQL in the job of a software engineer/developer. Most of my day was spent learning about SQL, however, I also did spend time in Vue.
