Today I learned about docker. 
I watched a 100 second long video on YouTube summerizing the basic concepts of docker and how it works.

Basically, docker is an open platform for developing, shipping and running applications. What docker does, which is handy, is enabling an application to work across computing environments. 

Three fundamental elements in the universe of docker are: 
* Docker file
* Image file
* The container

The docker file consists of code that tells docker how to build an image.   
The image is a snapshot of your software along with all its dependencies down to the operating system level. The image is unchangable.   
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies.

Just as how I know it with node package modules, docker has a platform from where one can exchange docker containers, called dockerhub.
