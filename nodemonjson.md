Today I learned about nodemon configuration. I was introduced as to how the node environment can be set in a nodemon.json file as well as how to customize shortcuts for calling 'nodemon [js.file]' in the terminal. I implimented this knowledge into my WebSocketPresentation project. 

I also re-watched Mosh's video on Debugging with the debug npm package. I plan to also impliment this into my projects so that console.log's used for deubgging only appear when the enviroment of the application is set to development.
