Today I looked into Blender and downloaded the program onto the computer. I looked into how to manage the program and also looked up some tutorials on Blender that could be interesting to follow. I am curious to learn ins and outs of this software.

Today I continued with the tutorial on how to make a donut in Blender. I learned how to get one of the standard shapes into frame to replace the standard cube, and then smothened and altered the shape. I also duplicated a part of the newly shaped object, to make the glacing.
