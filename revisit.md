These past few days I have been revisiting an old project of mine where I attempted to create a CRUD project with pure javascript.
As I want to go back to the very basics I thought this could be an interesting project to revisit and attempt to finish building. I am almost done with the create part of the application, however I am struggling with some of the styling. I hope to fix this issue very soon so I can continue to the update and delete part of the application.
