Today I fixed yesterday's issue where I wanted to implement fontello icons in my juneProject.   
However, yesterday I did not manage to succeed at making the icons show in document. I watched a video on YouTube demonstrating how to make fontello icons show successfully but decided to first try and fix the bug today.

Solving the bug today was relatively simple. It now works perfectly and each icon is used for different client status. I even rezied the icons and gave them different colors by using CSS.

Before bedtime I also went through a quiz on GitHub regarding different programming related questions that are meant to challenge one's knowledge. In the description of the test, it is recommended to look into these topics before a job interview. 

We had lots of fun going through the various topics and it was definitely learningful. Some concepts stick easier (are easier to understand) by now than prior. It feels good when one can notice progress themselves.
