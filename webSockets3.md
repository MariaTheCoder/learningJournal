# June 2021

## 29

At this time, I have about a week until the deadline of my june project. 

On this date I fixed the issue with the feature mentioned in the previous entry and even added a new feature where the presenter gets a fresh update on the status of all clients, as in whether they need assistance or completed a task which users can indicate by clicking either of two buttons. 
Likewise, if they haven't clicked any buttons just yet, the presenter sees this in their status update.

As of now, the status updates don't occur until the first client has pressed either button. Ideally, I want the status updates to be visible for the presenter as soon as the clients connect. 

That will be my next issue to look into.
