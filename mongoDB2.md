Today I progressed with my course on MongoDB. I completed a few exercises and worked through fixing errors in my own code in the process of finding a solution to the given exercises. 

I was also briefly introduced to different examples of how to edit a document in a Mongo Database. I did not have time to experiment with the code myself today but I plan on looking into this later this week if not tomorrow.
