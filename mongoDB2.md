Today I progressed with my course on MongoDB. I completed a few exercises and worked through fixing errors in my own code in the process of finding a solution to the given exercises.

I was also briefly introduced to different examples of how to edit a document in a Mongo Database. I did not have time to experiment with the code myself today but I plan on looking into this later this week if not tomorrow.

During the past week or so my focus has been less on hands on coding and more planning as to how to continue working with my webSocket Presentation project (previously mentioned as the June Project). Weeks ago I made a node with features that either need to be improved or implimented and I plan to spend tomorrow on working on these.
I also finished the MongoDB chapter of Mosh's project.
In retrospect, after finishing this chapter of the course, I was eager to learn more about Git so I began watching his course on Git. Whlie I have not watched more than a few videos into the course by now, I listened to a podcast from FreeCodeCamp on Git where they spoke about how Git is complicated and how this is due to there almost always being a way to redo what has been done so you can feel more safe with your projects if using git. Learning this from the podcast only got me more eager to learn more about Git. I hope to spend 20 minutes or so tomnorrow digging more into the Git course.

Today I been brushing up on what I learned last year about MongoDB and how to set up a backend for a project with MongoDB. I am rekindling this topic because I am about to start on a new project with a deadline. So far the specific deadline however is unknown.  
For a project that I am about to start working on, I also want to look into React Query
