## 22nd August 

Today I spent the day with getting to know the Google Chrome developer tool. I watched a video showing off the tools as well as explaining how they are used, while repeating the exercises myself. 

The goal today was to feel less intimidated by the developer tools by the end of the day and I do feel like that goal was achieved.
