For the last couple of days I have took a slightly deeper dive into Express. I learned about different types of middleware functions such as in-built, custom middleware and third party middleware. 

Regarding third party middleware, I was directed to this website www.expressjs.com where I read about third party middleware for Express. A few of them were very interesting to look further into. This includes:   
* morgan
* vhost
* response-time
* helmet
Especially vhost is interesting if one desires to use a virtual server to host multiple applications that listen on the same port but are accessed through different ports.
