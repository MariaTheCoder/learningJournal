Today I did not code on my WebSocket Presentation project (previously referenced as JuneProject). Instead, I continued with a course on Node.js by Mosh that I had previously started watching but chose to pause to instead focus on mentioned project. 

Today, I did half of the section regarding MongoDB which touched upon how to install MongoDB on one's laptop, how to connect one's node application to MongoDB by using npm package called Mongoose, how to create a schema to then model a class used to create documents - and lastly how to save these newly created documents to MongoDB. 

I also learnt how to get current documents stored in a specific database and how to filter, sort, find documents that live up to certain criteria, how to only return certain key-value pair information within these documents instead of all key-value pairs etc. 

To use more complex filtering in these cases, one can make use of comparison querty operations or logical querty operations. These topics were also elaborated on in today's lectures.
