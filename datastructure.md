I was adviced for the sake of my learning progress to look into data structures and algorithms. I was given resources (linkes to various websites, YouTube videos and more) that can hopefully introduce me to the topics.
Firstly, I will go through a website stating 7 essential data structures for a coding interview and associated common questions. Let us see how I will do..

The 7 data structures that I will be looking into are as listed

1. Arrays/Lists
1. Linked Lists
1. Hash Tables
1. Queues
1. Stacks
1. Trees (Binary)
1. Graphs
