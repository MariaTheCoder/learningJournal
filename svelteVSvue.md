## Week 49

This week I have been looking into how to work in Svelte and Vue as well as how they differ from one another. I am currently working on developing similar projects in both front-end frameworks for better and easier comparison between these two.
The finished project produced with these two frameworks should work similarly to my current book-keeping demo project.
Interestingly enough, I am so far experiencing more difficulties in Vue than in Svelte, especially when it comes to building a project locally, on my own computer.
As long as I stick to an online sandbox, everything seems to work just fine, but as soon as I move to my local computer, I can not see the project in the live server anymore.

I hope to look further into this issue...
