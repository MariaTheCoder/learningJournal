This week I have been diving a little into TypeScript and watched one tutorial on how TypeScript works. I also tried to use the little that I have learned about TypeScript in react and in my own private sandbox for TypeScript. However, I seem to need more practical examples of TypeScript projects until I can use the programming language efficiently.

Today I read articles about how TypeScript improves a dynamic programming language such as JavaScript. I also produced some code in my TypeScript sandbox, but nothing I have pushed to Github.
