For the past week or so I have been learning the programming language C. I am following tutorials from a website and look up additional material online for alternative examples / explanations of the same topics for better understanding.

Currently I am working on a task about linked lists. It is rather difficult to solve as the task itself contains many previously discussed topics. My progress and completed tasks can be found in my LearningC repository on GitHub.
