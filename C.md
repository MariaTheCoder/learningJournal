For the past week or so I have been learning the programming language C. I am following tutorials from a website and look up additional material online for alternative examples / explanations of the same topics for better understanding.

Currently I am working on a task about linked lists. It is rather difficult to solve as the task itself contains many previously discussed topics. My progress and completed tasks can be found in my LearningC repository on GitHub.

## November 23rd

Today I finished my task from the previous day on linked lists with a renewed and better understanding of the overall concept of linked lists.
I also started looking into the next topic, according to the tutorial based website that I use to learn C online. This topic is binary trees.
I read the material on the website but then went to YouTube for alternative explanations of the new found concepts. I have not yet solved a task on the topic of binary trees.
