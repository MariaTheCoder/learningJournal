Today I continued working on my express sandbox project. The project consists of a backend with an express.js server. The library joi is used to validate data which works for post requests. So far, using a joi validation for post requests work just fine. The problem appears with patch requests. I am still researching how to solve this while, if possible, keep the validation as an application level middleware function.
