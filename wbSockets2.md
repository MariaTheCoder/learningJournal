Since last journal entry I have been working intensely on my june project and it has progressed quite well. Right now I struggle with making a new feature of the application work as intended, the disconnect feature, where disconnected clients are removed from list of connected clients. Disconnected clients should be removed from list of connected users in presenter.html file.   
I hope to solve the bug tomorrow.

Once this feature works, I want to work on the feature for clients to request assistance from the presenter.
