Today I learned about how to modularize an existing CRUD application. I created a folder inside of the project called 'routes' and added a file inside this new folder called 'genres.js'.    
All of the code regarding HTTP request  handlers were copy pasted into this new js file and exported and then imported into the index file. 

Though I did not expect this simple task to take all of my study time for today, it did so, because I had to fix the mistakes I unknowingly did while trying to complete this exercise.
